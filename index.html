HT could not independently verify the authenticity of the video or the sequence of events before it. The video is claimed to be a longer and clearer clip of October 3 violence. The video shows a car, at high speed, ramming farmers. Before the car hit them, farmers were walking with flags. Two more cars followed the SUV which hit the crowd first. A lower resolution, shorter clip of the same video had earlier gone viral. Clip was shared by the opposition as proof that the convoy of minister's cars were to blame for Sunday's clashes. Eight people, including four farmers, were killed in Lakhimpur Kheri on Sunday. Farmers have accused Union Minister Ajay Kumar Mishra & his son Ashish Mishra in the case. FIR mentions MoS Home Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish Mishra's name. Farmer groups claim that the minister's son had been in a car in the convoy when the vehicle rammed into protesters. Ajay Mishra's son has however denied being present at the spot at the time of incident.
